/**
 Add this protocol to a view that you wish to contain a left view with an image inside.

 The simplest case consist in implementing `prepareToLayoutLeftView()` and then calling
 `layoutLeftView()` default's implementation.

 However, you must be careful to propertly initialized all the required properties and make sure
 the `leftView` is added to the view hierarchy before calling `layoutLeftView()`.

 The `leftView` is setup using autolayout. So, if you wish to override its constraints or
 properties, you can by setting new ones. The same appplies for the `leftImageView`.
 
 - Note: The `leftView` is added to the view hierarchy by calling `UIView.addSubview()`. However,
 in some weird cases it is not. So, you may need to call `setNeedsLayout` after adding the
 `leftView` to the view hierarchy and before calling `layoutLeftView()`.
